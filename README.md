 # Animania
The Anime app for you! 

This is an app where anime lovers can go to find information on their current favorites as well as find new ones thanks to our user's ratings!

[Demo Comming Soon]() 

## General Info
This web based app allows users to sign-up and create an account with us. Our home page allows users to view the currently top 50 rated animeâ€™s in descending order. Once an anime has been selected you will be show its current rating as well as how many members have favorited said show. In addition, you will be prompted if you would like to learn more about the current anime you are viewing. You will then be sent to that anime's page where you will find information such as its rank, user ratings, age rating, number of episodes and their length, airing status, a synopsis, as well as a trailer. 

## Inspiration
Our main driving force for creating this project is mainly due for our love of anime and we wanted to share that with everyone! We realized that making a web application to not only show user's what is being watched, but with all the information they could desire before jumping into a new a new series.

## Getting Started
### Backend
You will need to cd into the Animania folder, this is the Ruby on Rails backend folder. To get things started you will first need to ```bundle install```, this will install all the Ruby gems needed. If you encounter an error due to your version of ruby simply go to line 4 of the Gemfile and fix as needed i.e. ruby '2.6.5' to ruby '2.6.6'. You will then need to create your local database by running ```rake db:migrate```. In addition you will need to seed your database by running ```rake db:seed``` in your console. Once everything has completed you can start your rails server by running ```rails s```.
### Frontend
To get your frontend up and running you will simply need to cd in the Animania-app folder, this is the JavaScript frontend folder. To start up your frontend server you will simply need to run ```lite-server```, if not installed I highly recommend it, will open Animania in your browser.
